# C module of SyndromeDecodingEstimator

This library provides functions for the calculation of the asymptotic workfractors of various ISD algorithms. 

The source files are wrapped in a development framework, allowing for benchmarking and unit testing. But for the bare use of the estimator this is not of any importance. For usage of the library please install the SyndromeDecodingEstimator as described in the main README file. The functionalities of the C libraryr can then be accessed via python wrapper functions provided via ``theoretical_estimates.py``.
